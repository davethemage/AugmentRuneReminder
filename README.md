# Augment Rune Reminder
**Augment Rune Reminder** is a simple addon that adds a clickable frame to your UI when you are missing your Augmentation Rune!

**Current Features:**
Shows a clickable button on screen if the augment rune buff is missing, the item exists in your bags, and it’s off cooldown.

**Limitations:**
Currently only works with the Ethereal Augment Rune

**Future Plans:**
Add other augment runes(in a priority list)
Add an option for font
